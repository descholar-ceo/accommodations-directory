## Description
AccommodationDirectory is a web application that helps to find any accommodation you wish depending on the location. You can search with the keyword of your choice or you can see which ones are already available.

I did it for learning purpose, the aim was to create a customized content but the same design of [Patashule](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) by [Mathew Njuguna](https://www.behance.net/mathewnjuguna) to master the HTML5 and CSS3 / SASS for UI/UX and responsiveness. This project is my capstone from [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) after completing HTML/CSS curriculum.

_Note: The result of this project is only a page design. It is not functional yet. It just shows the looking of the real page._
